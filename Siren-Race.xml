<p>Sirens commonly appear as an amalgamation of a beautiful woman and some form of sea life; typically, they acquire features such as fins, claws, gills, and tails, and wield these features as natural extensions of their own bodies. Some have even been known to possess wings, a trait reminiscent of seafowl, but one used to deadly effect.</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p>The sirens of the Emerald Coast are not born in the way mortals understand life. They are spawned through an ancient rite known as The Crimson Calling—a sacred blood ritual performed only by the reigning Matron. This rite draws on the accumulated lifeblood of mortals, harvesting both flesh and essence. When enough essence has been gathered, a siren begins to ascend, eventually performing the Calling herself, sacrificing her form to create new sirens.</p>
<h4>Society</h4>
<p>Sirens are fascinated with art, particularly song. They dwell in deep coral structures adorned with pearlescent carvings and treasures. Their matriarchal society is led by a Matron, followed by elite Maidens who may one day succeed her through the Crimson Calling.</p>
<h4>Siren Names</h4>
<p>Sirens tend toward fluid, melodic names.</p>
